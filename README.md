# Welcome to Maria Beletsky's Assignment B1 for STAT 545B 2024

In this repo you will find my Assignment B1, which is located in the .Rmd file "assignment-b1-mbeletsky.Rmd". To view the project, open the .Rmd file in GitHub or a program of your choice such as RStudio.

Assignment B1 is all about making, documenting, showing examples of, and testing a simple function in R. My function **group_then_sumz()** recreates a **group_by()** %>% **summarize()** dplyr workflow that may be useful to repeat when exploring datasets. I use the "vancouver_trees" dataset from the "datateachr" R package as an example dataset to use my function on.

The .Rmd file can be knitted to an .html file if you wish for easier viewing.
