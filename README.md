# Welcome to Maria Beletsky's Assignment B1 for STAT 545B 2024

In this repo you will find my Assignment B1, which is located in the .Rmd file "assignment-b1-mbeletsky". The .Rmd file has been knitted to an .md file for easier viewing. The .Rmd file is the source for the .md file of the same name. Please view the .md file to see the assignment. 

Assignment B1 is all about making, documenting, showing examples of, and testing a simple function in R. My function **group_then_sumz()** recreates a **group_by()** %>% **summarize()** dplyr workflow that may be useful to repeat when exploring datasets. I use the "vancouver_trees" dataset from the "datateachr" R package as an example dataset to use my function on.
